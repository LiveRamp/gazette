Building and Testing Gazette
============================

Most binaries and packages are "pure" Go and can be directly go-installed and go-tested:
```bash
$ export GO111MODULE=on

$ go install go.gazette.dev/core/cmd/gazette
$ go install go.gazette.dev/core/cmd/gazctl
$ go test go.gazette.dev/core/broker/...
$ go test go.gazette.dev/core/consumer
```

Certain packages used by consumer applications, like `go.gazette.dev/core/consumer/store-rocksdb`,
require CGO to build and also require appropriate development libraries for RocksDB.
Standard Linux packages are insufficient, as run-time type information must be enabled
in the RocksDB build (and it's turned off in the standard Debian package, for example).

Gazette uses a [Make-based build system](../mk/build.mk) which pulls down and stages
development dependencies into a `.build` sub-directory of the repository root:

```bash
$ make go-install
$ make go-test-fast
```

Continuous integration builds of Gazette run tests 15 times, with race detection enabled:
```bash
$ make go-test-ci
```

The Make build system offers fully hermetic builds using a Docker-in-Docker
builder:

```bash
# Run CI tests in a hermetic build environment.
$ make as-ci target=go-test-ci

# Package release Docker images for the Gazette broker and examples.
$ make as-ci target=ci-release-broker
$ make as-ci target=ci-release-examples
```

Deploy Gazette's continuous soak test to a Kubernetes cluster (which can be
Docker for Desktop or Minikube). The `kustomize` directory has a helper
manifest for running using local, development builds.

```bash
# Run the soak test with official `latest` images.
$ kubectl kustomize ./kustomize/test/bases/soak/ | kubectl apply -f -
```
